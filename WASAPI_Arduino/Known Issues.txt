1. Can be seen as a threat by SmartScreen - Ain't nobody can fix it
2. Having tickrate faster than 65Hz creates ~450 nulls in around 5 minutes of working. Increasing tickrate doesn't
have an effect in the null creating tempo, while it has a visible effect on how LED stripe behave, so tickrate does
change.
3. Wonky correctors textbox implementation, when stops working the textbox needs to be cleared, then next input will
make it work again. A minor issue so I don't really want to waste more time on it.
4. If you put too high corrector the program will refuse to give proper output, probably normalization side issue. It's 
fixed once you restart it.
